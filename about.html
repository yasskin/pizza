        <h1>Vera Pizza Napoletana</h1>
        <p>Vera Pizza Napoletana is a pizzeria whose goal is to promote and protect the name and the product Pizza Napoletana; a style of pizza and tradition found in Naples. The term Vera, or Verace, means true, genuine, or real.</p>

            <p>While there is A great love for Pizza Napoletana around the world, and many of us take frequent trips to Naples primarily for the food, the Vera Pizza Napoletana brand itself is very small and very fragmented. Unlike wine, cheese, or olive oil, where there are strict production rules, and a government seal and tracking number are printed on every product, Pizza Napoletana production is impossible to control, and there is no government-based system for certifying pizzerias. While the Verace Pizza Napoletana trade association has created its own certification system, it is voluntary, and membership is tiny and primarily in Naples, with only a few hundred members globally (including about 15 pizzerias in the United States). On the other hand, there are many thousands of pizzerias throughout Italy listing Pizza Napoletana DOC on menus every day, without certification. For example, there are scores of wood-fired pizzerias in Florence, including many that claim to make Pizza Napoletana DOC, but only two VPN-certified pizzerias.</p>
            <br>
            <p> It also important to bear in mind that there are 15 other professional pizza, pizzeria and pizzaiolo trade associations in Italy — in addition to VPN, including the Associazione Pizzaioli Napoletani, and that many important Pizza Napoletana supporters are not Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana members.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Is this good, or bad?
            It’s a good thing. For the American or British pizzeria owner, while this market landscape presents a challenge, it also presents an excellent opportunity to interpret Pizza Napoletana in a way that works for you, your business and your customers. You can treat VPN as a philosophy; a series of guidelines; or as a strict set of rules; and you can choose to either leverage VPN certification to your advantage, and take advantage of the marketing opportunities it provides, or you can ignore it. The choice is yours.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Whatever you choose, this is all good news. The Vera Pizza Napoletana movement has done a good job of raising visibility for Pizza Napoletana, Italian pizza as a whole, and Artisan pizza of all stripes, and has helped everyone — pizzeria owners and their customers — focus on ingredients, technique, quality and a better pizza.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What are the basic VPN Guidelines?
            They really are pretty simple.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. A Wood-Burning Oven: Pizza Napoletana must be cooked in a wood-fired dome oven operating at roughly 800ºF.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Proper Ingredients: Tipo 00 flour, San Marzano tomatoes, all natural Fior di Latte or Bufala mozzarella, fresh basil, salt, and yeast — only fresh, all-natural, non-processed ingredients.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Proper Technique: Your pizza dough must be kneaded either by hand or with a low speed mixer. No mechanical dough shaping is allowed, such as a dough press or rolling pin, and proper pizza preparation. Pizza baking time should not exceed 90 seconds.</p>
