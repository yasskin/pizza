## Description

_A Student Project_
[Vera Pizza Napoletana] (https://yasskin.github.io/pizza "Order Pizza")

_Order Pizza: User Interface_
* _A website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost. Allows the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order._
* _Styled with CSS and images._

_Order Pizza: Business Logic_
* _Creates a pizza object constructor in JavaScript with properties for toppings and size._
* _Creates a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Uses a proprietary formula for this.

_Order Pizza: Stage Two: Business Logic (Some of these may be offered in the future)_
* _Allows users to order more than one pizza with different toppings._
* _Displays the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details._
* _Offer a delivery option that then requires address information._
